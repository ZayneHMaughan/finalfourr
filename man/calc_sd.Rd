\title{Calculate Standard Deviation for Simulated team}
\usage{
calc_sd(pts, efg, tov_rate)
}
\arguments{
\item{pts}{Numeric. Expected number of points scored in the game.}

\item{efg}{Numeric. Effective field goal percentage (between 0 and 1).}

\item{tov_rate}{Numeric. Turnover rate (between 0 and 1).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the clamped standard deviation
of the team's score. The value is bounded between 3 and 15.
}
\description{
Estimates the standard deviation of a team's score in a simulated game
based on its expected points, offensive efficiency (eFG\%), and turnover rate.
The function is designed to reflect inconsistency from inefficient offenses
or turnover-prone teams.
}
\details{
The standard deviation is calculated as 5\% of expected points (\code{pts}) plus
a penalty for poor shooting and ball control:
\itemize{
\item \code{(1 - efg) * 10} reflects the inefficiency of shooting
\item \code{tov_rate * 8} reflects the cost of turnovers
}
The total standard deviation is then clamped to a minimum of 3 and
a maximum of 15 to prevent unrealistic variance.
