\title{Simulate a Matchup Between Two Teams}
\usage{
simulate_matchup(team1, team2, input_year, n_sim = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{team1}{A character string indicating the first team.}

\item{team2}{A character string indicating the second team.}

\item{input_year}{An integer specifying the year to filter the data.}

\item{n_sim}{Number of simulations to run (default is 1000).}
}
\value{
This function prints the simulation results to the console,
including:
\itemize{
\item Number of wins for each team
\item Win percentages
\item The predicted winner based on the majority of wins
}
}
\description{
Simulates \code{n_sim} games between two NCAA basketball teams for a given year
using adjusted offensive and defensive metrics from KenPom-style data. This
function estimates each team's scoring potential and variability, runs a
Monte Carlo simulation of multiple games, and returns estimated win
probabilities along with a predicted winner.
}
\details{
For each simulated game, the model:
\enumerate{
\item Estimates the expected number of possessions by averaging
both teams' tempo.
\item Calculates each team’s expected score using their offensive
efficiency and the opponent’s defensive efficiency.
\item Uses a custom standard deviation function (\code{calc_sd()})
to introduce score variability based on a team's efficiency
and turnover rate.
\item Draws scores for each team from a normal distribution based
on the calculated mean (expected score) and
standard deviation (team's efficiency).
\item Compares scores to determine the winner of each simulation.
}

This model is \strong{stochastic}, not deterministic. Because scores are drawn
from a random distribution, the simulation includes variability and
uncertainty — the same input may yield slightly different win
probabilities each time it's run.

The final prediction is based on which team wins the majority
of the simulated games.
The function also relies on \code{validate_compare_inputs()}to ensure teams and
year are valid before simulating.
