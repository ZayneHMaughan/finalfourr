\title{Simulate a Matchup Between Two Teams}
\usage{
simulate_matchup(team1, team2, input_year, n_sim = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{team1}{A character string indicating the first team.}

\item{team2}{A character string indicating the second team.}

\item{input_year}{An integer specifying the year to filter the data.}

\item{n_sim}{Number of simulations to run (default is 1000).}
}
\value{
This function prints the simulation results to the console,
including:
\itemize{
\item Number of wins for each team
\item Win percentages
\item The predicted winner based on the majority of wins
}
}
\description{
Simulates \code{n_sim} games between two teams for a given year using adjusted
offensive and defensive metrics, estimating win probabilities and declaring
a predicted winner based on simulation results.
}
\details{
The simulation uses a basic normal distribution model to estimate scores
per game and calculates which team wins each simulated matchup.
The function also relies on \code{validate_compare_inputs()}to ensure teams and
year are valid before simulating.

# Simulate 1000 games between Utah and Baylor in 2015
simulate_matchup("Utah", "Baylor", 2015)

# Simulate only 100 games
simulate_matchup("Utah", "Baylor", 2022, n_sim = 100)
